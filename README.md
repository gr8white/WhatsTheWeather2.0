# What's The Weather 2.0
Rebuilt my old [What's The Weather App](https://github.com/gr8white/WhatsTheWeatherApp) but instead of scraping a website for data, i leanred how to utilize API's to manipulate JSON data.

## Getting Started

'What's the Wather 2.0' is my introduction to utilizing API's to manipulate JSON data. This allows safer development that won't break if the host website changes any of their HTML.

### iOS Features Used

* Downloading Web Content in the form of JSON DATA
* Manipulating Strings
